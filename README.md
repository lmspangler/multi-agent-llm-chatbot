# Multi-Agent LLM Chatbot Project
This project uses various agents to plan, write, and edit an article. I followed the tutorial found at https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/multi-ai-agent-systems-with-crewai/lesson/eusjw/create-agents-to-research-and-write-an-article-(code). I used CrewAI, OpenAI and gpt 3.5 Turbo.
